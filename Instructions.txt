INSTRUCTIONS:
Open a Linux terminal
Navigate to src directory
Compile program
Execute program using files as input and output


Program compiling:
To change file, simply substitute "source" to the desired file's name (without extensions) in the commands.

Compiler command:
make source

Program execution:
Input from stdin, output on stdout, used by verifier program.

To execute reading from and writing to file, use command:
./source < input_file > output_file

Example:
./source < "../tests/open1.txt" > "../tests/output.txt"

To contrast expected and written output files use command:
diff ./expected_output_file ./program_output_file

Example:
diff ./"../tests/open1.output.txt" ./"../tests/program.output.txt"
diff ./"../tests/open2.output.txt" ./"../tests/program.output.txt"

To change test case simply rewrite the file names of the input and expected output.
